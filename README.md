The [MDAnalysis User Group Meeting](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2024/) (UGM) will bring together users and developers of the MDAnalysis package from different communities. Our goal is to foster an interdisciplinary opportunity to connect for researchers and developers across biomolecular simulations, soft matter, biophysics and more. This repository includes relevant materials for the UGM.

## When and Where

## Health and Safety
We are committed to providing a safe, comfortable, and healthy environment for the MDAnalysis UGM and have looked to local and international entities and other organizations in the open source community to develop onsite safety measures for UGM attendees.

### Vaccine Policy
MDAnalysis strongly recommends that UGM attendees remain current (i.e., receiving all recommended primary and booster doses recommended by your local government) with their COVID-19 vaccinations as a personal protective measure.

### Testing
A COVID-19 test result is not required to determine whether you can attend the UGM. A limited number of rapid self-tests will be made available at check-in for those who would like to test themselves for COVID-19 during the meeting.

*Testing Positive for COVID-19*

Individuals who are COVID-positive should not attend the UGM. If you receive a positive COVID-19 test result during the UGM, please [notify the MDAnalysis UGM organizing committee](mailto:ugm@mdanalysis.org) and do not return to the event while you are still COVID-positive.

### Face Coverings
Face coverings are not required, but are welcomed. We view face coverings as a personal choice and will support attendees in their choice to wear or not to wear a face covering.

### Social Distancing and Hygiene
While we will be unable to enforce social distancing guidelines during the UGM, there is extra seating capacity at the venue that allows for voluntary distancing. At check-in, you will have the option to indicate your comfort level with social distancing on your name tag.
